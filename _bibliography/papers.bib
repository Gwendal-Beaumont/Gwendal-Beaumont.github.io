ABSTRACT = {The virus that causes COVID-19 changes over time, occasionally leading to Variants of Interest (VOIs) and Variants of Concern (VOCs) that can behave differently with respect to detection kits, treatments, or vaccines. For instance, two vaccination doses were 61% effective against the BA.1 predominant variant, but only 24% effective when BA.2 became predominant. While doses still confer protection against severe disease outcomes, the BA.5 variant demonstrates the possibility that individuals who have received a few doses built for previous variants can still be infected with newer variants. As previous vaccines become less effective, new ones will be released to target specific variants and the whole process of vaccinating the population will restart. While previous models have detailed logistical aspects and disease progression, there are three additional key elements to model COVID-19 vaccination coverage in the long term. First, the willingness of the population to participate in regular vaccination campaigns is essential for long-term effective COVID-19 vaccination coverage. Previous research has shown that several categories of variables drive vaccination status: sociodemographic, health-related, psychological, and information-related constructs. However, the inclusion of these categories in future models raises questions about the identification of specific factors (e.g., which sociodemographic aspects?) and their operationalization (e.g., how to initialize agents with a plausible combination of factors?). While previous models separately accounted for natural- and vaccine-induced immunity, the reality is that a significant fraction of individuals will be both vaccinated and infected over the coming years. Modeling the decay in immunity with respect to new VOCs will thus need to account for hybrid immunity. Finally, models rarely assume that individuals make mistakes, even though this over-reliance on perfectly rational individuals can miss essential dynamics. Using the U.S. as a guiding example, our scoping review summarizes these aspects (vaccinal choice, immunity, and errors) through ten recommendations to support the modeling community in developing long-term COVID-19 vaccination models.},

abstract = {COVID-19 vaccines are important for individuals to avoid severe illness and collectively to prevent significant societal disruptions from uncontrolled disease spread. Vaccine adoption depends both on objective data about vaccine efficiency and on perceptions, which are shaped by individual characteristics and peer influences. Despite the abundance of Agent-Based Models (ABMs) models for COVID-19 and the long-term need for booster doses, ABMs have not yet accounted for the interplay of individual and collective drivers of vaccine adoption. In this explanatory study, we modify the validated COVASIM framework such that agents observe their peersâ€™ characteristics (derived from several datasets), use machine learning to reflect and then take decisions based on their own characteristics. We show that specific decision-making errors are necessary to replicate the real-world prevalence of COVID-19 vaccine coverage in the USA. Specifically, agents must only observe simple features of their peers (e.g., age, sex) rather than personal information (e.g., comorbidities).},

abstract = {Across common ABM frameworks (e.g., BDI, SOAR, ACT-R) errors in human perceptions are inconsistently handled through implementation or lack thereof. Without the proper integration or absence of key human behaviors, researchers in cognitive social simulations may overlook various features that would have affected the overall model trajectory. We address this concern by developing a framework that illustrates the value of agents possessing internal models that are driven by Machine Learning. We illustrate the impact of this framework on three well-known models (Schelling, Sugarscape, Axelrod) and on a COVID-19 simulation. Our work employs various Machine Learning models (e.g., Decision Tree Classifier, Logistic Regressor) to depict how the inclusion of human errors alters the overall model trajectory and may justify the integration of imperfections and heterogeneity into individual decision-making processes. Our open source framework can be integrated into existing and future models and utilized to examine the consequences of an agent making a decision without the appropriate amount of information (insufficient observation), by ignoring specific information (superficial observation), when inaccurately recording information (inaccurate perception), or due to a gap between environmental complexity and individual capacity (limited ability).}
